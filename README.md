# xylophone

## Description

A simple application built with Flutter and Dart which displays colorful xylophone keys. When the keys are pressed, they play different notes. In this project, I learned to use packages, specifically the AudioPlayers package. I also leanred about splitting certain code elements into a separate funciton so they are not repeated many times.
